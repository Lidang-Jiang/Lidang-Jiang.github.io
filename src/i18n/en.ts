    p1: 'From September 2014 to July 2018, I studied Applied Chemistry at Jinzhong University. After graduating and working for a year, I took the National Graduate Entrance Examination twice — scoring 263 in 2020 and 400 in 2021. After passing the exam and interview, I spent some time working in the education and training industry.',
    p2: 'From September 2021 to July 2024, I pursued my master\'s degree at the School of Materials and Chemical Engineering, Sichuan University, where I received the university\'s Second-Class Academic Scholarship for three consecutive years. During my graduate studies, I focused on research at the intersection of AI and Lithium-ion Batteries (LiBs). I published one first-author paper each in Energy and Applied Energy (both CAS and JCR Q1 journals).',
    p3: 'After completing my master\'s, I gained practical engineering experience in AI and full-stack web development (Vue, Spring Boot). My current research interests include AI4Science, Agents, Generative AI, Deep Learning, LLMs, and MLsys.',
