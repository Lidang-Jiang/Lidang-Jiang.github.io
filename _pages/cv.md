## Self-evaluation

During my graduate studies, I primarily focused on research at the intersection of AI and lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). As the first author, I have published two papers in *Energy* and *Applied Energy* (both are Q1 journals in CAS and JCR rankings). Throughout these three years of master's studies, I developed the ability to independently conduct interdisciplinary research.

While working as a large model algorithm engineer, I learned and mastered technologies such as word embedding models, RAG (Milvus), Agents, LangChain, fine-tuning, chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, large model testing, and common large model (e.g., company's self-developed TeleChat, QWen, ChatGPT) API usage methods. Additionally, I also learned and mastered front-end development technologies.

My current research interests include AI4Science, Agents, Generative AI, Deep Learning, LLMs, and MLsys.
