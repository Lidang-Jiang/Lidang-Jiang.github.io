## Self-evaluation

- **Education**: College entrance examination (502 points), undergraduate GPA (2.9/5, ranked 45/50). Scored 263 in the 2020 postgraduate entrance examination and 400 in the 2021 postgraduate entrance examination (8/120), with a score of 141 in Mathematics II (1/120). Graduate GPA is 3.5/4, ranking in the top 30%.
  
- **Research**: During my graduate studies, I focused on the intersection of machine learning and lithium-ion batteries. At the algorithm level, I have mastered machine learning, deep learning, and some simple generative AI algorithms. In terms of engineering, I am proficient in using cloud computing platforms (such as Alibaba Cloud), Git, Docker, Linux, distributed training, etc. Additionally, I have conducted some experimental projects on silicon-carbon batteries, familiar with commonly used material characterization methods, and some common coin cell experiments.

- **Publications**: During my master's program, I have authored or co-authored 3 academic papers as the first author. The first paper has been published in *Energies* (IF=3.2), and the second and third papers are currently under review in *Energy* (IF=9) and *Applied Energy* (IF=11.2) respectively. Over the three years of my master's program, I have developed the ability to independently conduct interdisciplinary scientific research. My current research interests include AI for Science, generative AI, deep learning, LLMs, and ML systems.
