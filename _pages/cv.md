## Self-evaluation

- **Research**: During my graduate studies, I focused primarily on the intersection of AI and lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). As the first author, I have published or submitted two papers in journals ranked Q1 by both the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). One of the papers is in *Energy* (IF=9), and the other is in *Applied Energy* (IF=11.2). Throughout these three years of my Master's studies, I developed the ability to independently conduct interdisciplinary research.

- **Work Experience**: While working as a large model algorithm engineer, I learned and mastered various technologies, including word embedding models, RAG (Milvus), Agent, Langchain, fine-tuning, chain of thought, few-shot learning, and large model testing. In addition, I also became familiar with the API usage methods for large models developed by various companies, such as TeleChat (in-house), Tsinghua's ChatGLM, Alibaba's QWen, and OpenAI.

- **Current Research Interests**: My current research interests include AI4Science, Agents, Generative AI, Deep Learning, LLMs, and MLsys.
