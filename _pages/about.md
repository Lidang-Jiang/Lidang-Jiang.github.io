## Brief Self-Introduction

<ul>
  <li>I studied Applied Chemistry at Jinzhong University from September 2014 to July 2018. After graduating and working for a year, I took the national postgraduate entrance exams in 2020 and 2021, scoring 263 and 400, respectively. After completing the entrance exams and interviews, I worked in the education and training sector for a period.</li>

  <li>From September 2021 to July 2024, I pursued my Master's degree in Materials and Chemical Engineering at Sichuan University, where I was awarded the second-class academic scholarship for three consecutive years. During my graduate studies, I focused on interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI and LiBs (Lithium-ion Batteries). As the first author, I published two papers in <em>Energy</em> and <em>Applied Energy</em>, both ranked as Q1 in the Chinese Academy of Sciences and JCR. Over these three years of Master's study, I developed the ability to independently conduct interdisciplinary research.</li>

  <li>While working as a large language model algorithm engineer, I quickly mastered a variety of large language model technologies (e.g., RAG, LangChain, fine-tuning, few-shot learning, etc.). Additionally, I expanded my skill set in front-end development, building full-stack development capabilities.</li>
