    <p>Early prediction of End of Life (EPEOL) is crucial for improving lithium battery efficiency and lifespan. Traditional fixed-architecture neural networks often suffer from underfitting or overfitting due to diverse data distributions. To address this, we propose the Flexible Parallel Neural Network (FPNN)...</p>
