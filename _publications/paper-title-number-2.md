<!-- <p>In optimizing the performance and extending the lifespan of lithium batteries, accurate state prediction is crucial. Traditional regression and classification methods have achieved some success in predicting battery states. However, the effectiveness of these data-driven approaches largely depends on the availability and quality of public datasets. Additionally, generating electrochemical data primarily through battery experiments is a lengthy and costly process, making it extremely difficult to obtain high-quality data. This difficulty, combined with data incompleteness, significantly affects prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, this study introduces End of Life (EOL) and Equivalent Cycle Life (ECL) as supervised conditions for generative AI models. By integrating an embedding layer into the CVAE model, we developed the Refined Conditional Variational Autoencoder (RCVAE). Through preprocessing data into a quasi-video format, coupled with customized training and inference algorithms, the RCVAE generates the required charging data in real time based on the batteryâ€™s ECL and EOL. This avoids storing irrelevant information, saving space and resources.</p>

<p>RCVAE uses a lightweight architecture, enabling fast generation of necessary voltage, current, temperature, and charging capacity data. This approach provides users with a comprehensive electrochemical dataset, pioneering a new research domain for the artificial synthesis of lithium battery data. Furthermore, based on the detailed synthetic data, various battery state indicators can be calculated, offering new perspectives and possibilities for lithium battery performance prediction.</p> -->
